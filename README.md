# selfoss - Webfront - V1.0

A newspaper style webfront for the selfoss RSS reader(https://github.com/fossar/selfoss).

I never liked RSS readers very much as the user interface is just plain ugly. I wanted to have
a nice looking user interface that feels like a newspaper, and not like some technical list. 
And ideally, I wanted to have the full article, and not just a teaser. When I came across selfoss
that can fetch the full article (with some limits), I felt I want to use that as a base for my
personal "Morning Post".

- Website that looks like a newspaper
- Based on Bootstrap blog example (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/blog/)
- Fixed to 11 categories

## Configuration

1. Define the settings of your database (it's tested for MySql, not sure if other databases will work)
2. Define the name of your "newspaper" and choose the font
3. Define your categories (11 needed)

## Development

Please excuse the spaghetti code. But it does work, so...

## Credits

Thanks to awesome selfoss, as without that this wouldn't be possible. 
And thanks to Stackoverflow and countless other pages/forum to help me get my code done.
